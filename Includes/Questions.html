                <p class="answer" id="answer1">By reducing air and water pollution and saving energy, recycling
                    offers an
                    important environmental benefit: it reduces emissions of greenhouse gases, such as
                    carbon
                    dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons, that contribute to global
                    climate

                <a class="ques" target="2"><br>What happens with the garbage we recycle? Where does it go?<br></a>
                <p class="answer" id="answer2">
                    The paper and cardboard is transferred to a recycling plant that turns the waste into
                    a new raw material for the production of paper products. <br>
                    The plastic bottles that are recycled goes to a plastic recycling plant and become a raw
                    material for the production of plastic products such as: baskets, furniture and
                    brass.<br>
                    The glass is transferred to a glass recycling plant for the production of new
                    products.<br>
                    The packaging is stored, sorted according to the different types of materials and
                    transferred to the various recycling plants.<br>
                    The electronic waste is transferred to a suitable recycling plant that breaks down the
                    waste
                    into an issue and transfers it for recycling to various plants.<br>
                    Textile waste, clothing and fabrics, are used for reuse and some are transferred to
                    recycling plants for the production of rags and various fabric products.

                    tank?<br></a>
                <P class="answer" id="answer4">
                    This bin is intended for everything that is not recyclable - the wet / organic waste (food scraps),
                    used nappies, wipes and more. When the waste is separated into an issue, there is very little waste
                    left for the green bin.
                </P>

                <a class="ques" target="5"><br>Why is it important to sort my recycled garbage? Why can't I put
                    everything I
                    recycle in one
                    tank?<br></a>
                <p class="answer" id="answer5">
                    The landfills in the State of Israel are disappearing, many landfills have been closed and filled
                    and the remaining ones will only last for a few years. The more waste we separate and transfer to
                    recycling plants for the production of new materials, the less waste we get to landfill.

                <p class="answer" id="answer8">
                    Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place.
                    The cause of current climate change is largely human activity, like burning fossil fuels, like
                    natural gas, oil, and coal. Burning these materials releases what are called greenhouse gases into
                    Earth's atmosphere.
                </p>

                <a class="ques" target="9"><br>What are the 5 main causes of climate change?<br></a>
                <ul class="answer" id="answer9">
                    <li>Burning coal, oil and gas produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide</li>
                    <li>Cutting down forests (deforestation)</li>
                    <li>Increasing livestock farming</li>
                    <li>Fertilisers containing nitrogen produce nitrous oxide emissions</li>
                    <li>Fluorinated gases are emitted from equipment and products that use these gases</li>
                </ul>

                <a class="ques" target="10"><br>What are two effects of climate change on the environment?<br></a>
                <p class="answer" id="answer10">
                    Increased heat, drought and insect outbreaks, all linked to climate change, have increased
                    wildfires. Declining water supplies, reduced agricultural yields, health impacts in cities due to
                    heat, and flooding and erosion in coastal areas are additional concerns
