                <p class="answer" id="answer1">By reducing air and water pollution and saving energy, recycling
                    offers an
                    important environmental benefit: it reduces emissions of greenhouse gases, such as
                    carbon
                    dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons, that contribute to global
                    climate
                    change.

                    The paper and cardboard is transferred to a recycling plant that turns the waste into
                    a new raw material for the production of paper products. <br>
                    The plastic bottles that are recycled goes to a plastic recycling plant and become a raw
                    material for the production of plastic products such as: baskets, furniture and
                    brass.<br>
                    The glass is transferred to a glass recycling plant for the production of new
                    products.<br>
                    The packaging is stored, sorted according to the different types of materials and
                    transferred to the various recycling plants.<br>
                    The electronic waste is transferred to a suitable recycling plant that breaks down the
                    waste
                    into an issue and transfers it for recycling to various plants.<br>
                    Textile waste, clothing and fabrics, are used for reuse and some are transferred to
                    recycling plants for the production of rags and various fabric products.

                    This bin is intended for everything that is not recyclable - the wet / organic waste (food scraps),
                    used nappies, wipes and more. When the waste is separated into an issue, there is very little waste
                    left for the green bin.

                    tank?<br></a>

                    The landfills in the State of Israel are disappearing, many landfills have been closed and filled
                    and the remaining ones will only last for a few years. The more waste we separate and transfer to
                    recycling plants for the production of new materials, the less waste we get to landfill.
